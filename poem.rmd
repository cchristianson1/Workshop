A million stars up in the sky.

One shines brighter - I can't deny.

A love so precious, a love so true,

a love that comes from me to you.

The angels sing when you are near.

Within your arms I have nothing to fear.

You always know just what to say. 

Just talking to you makes my day.

I love you, honey, with all of my heart.

Together forever and never to part.
